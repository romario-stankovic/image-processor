<h1 align="center">Image Processor</h1>

"Image Processor" is a final exam project from the "Object Oriented Programming 2" course at Singidunum University. The course was designed to teach students about OOP concepts through C++. To combine the knowledge gained from the course, the students were tasked with creating a program that uses OOP concepts.

The project had a free topic and it required that we use OOP concepts learned throughout the course. The topic was an Image Processing program that takes an input image and applies one or more various filters over the image, after which it can be saved again back on the file system. The programs contains a menu that allows the user to select the image, apply filters, save the image, and save the filter settings as a preset.
